 * Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be
 * validated according to the following rules:
 *
 *
 * Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without
 * repetition.
 *
 *
 *
 * A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
 *
 * The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled
 * with the character '.'.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 * ⁠ ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 * ⁠ ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 * ⁠ [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 * ⁠ ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 * ⁠ ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 * ⁠ ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 * ⁠ [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 * ⁠ [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 * ⁠ [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
 * ]
 * Output: true
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 * ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 * ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 * [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 * ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 * ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 * ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 * [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 * [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 * [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
 * ]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner
 * being
 * ⁠   modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it
 * is invalid.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily
 * solvable.
 * Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned
 * rules.
 * The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
 * The given board size is always 9x9.
