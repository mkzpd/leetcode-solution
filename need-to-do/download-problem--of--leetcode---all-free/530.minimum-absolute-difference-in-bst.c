 *
 * Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
 * absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * ⁠  1
 * ⁠   \
 * ⁠    3
 * ⁠   /
 * ⁠  2
 * 
 * Output:
 * 1
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and
 * 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
