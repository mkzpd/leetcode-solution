 * Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise
 * disjoint and in sorted order.
 * 
 * Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
 * 
 * (Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real
 * numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a
 * set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed
 * interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2,
 * 3].)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B =
 * [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
 * Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
 * Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects,
 * and not arrays or lists.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= A.length < 1000
 * 0 <= B.length < 1000
 * 0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to
 * default code definition to get new method signature.
