 * Testcase Example:  '[0,1,2,3,4,3,4]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25
 * representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of
 * 1 represents 'b', and so on.
 * 
 * Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this
 * tree and ends at the root.
 * 
 * (As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller:
 * for example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".  A leaf of a node
 * is a node that has no children.)

 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
 * Output: "dba"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
 * Output: "adz"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
 * Output: "abc"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.
 * Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.
