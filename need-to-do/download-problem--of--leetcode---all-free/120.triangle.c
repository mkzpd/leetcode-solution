 *
 * Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step
 * you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
 * 
 * For example, given the following triangle
 * 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠    [2],
 * ⁠   [3,4],
 * ⁠  [6,5,7],
 * ⁠ [4,1,8,3]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n
 * is the total number of rows in the triangle.
