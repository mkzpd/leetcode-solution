 *
 * Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for
 * each cell.
 * 
 * The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,0]]
 * 
 * Output:
 * [[0,0,0],
 * [0,1,0],
 * [0,0,0]]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2: 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0],
 * ⁠[1,1,1]]
 * 
 * Output:
 * [[0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0],
 * ⁠[1,2,1]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
 * There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
 * The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.
