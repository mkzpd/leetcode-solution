 * Testcase Example:  '"hello"\n"ll"'
 *
 * Implement strStr().
 * 
 * Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if
 * needle is not part of haystack.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Clarification:
 * 
 * What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great
 * question to ask during an interview.
 * 
 * For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty
 * string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
