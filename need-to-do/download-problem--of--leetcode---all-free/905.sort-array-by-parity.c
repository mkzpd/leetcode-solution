 * Testcase Example:  '[3,1,2,4]'
 *
 * Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all
 * the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
 * 
 * You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,1,2,4]
 * Output: [2,4,3,1]
 * The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 5000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 5000
