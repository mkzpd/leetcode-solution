 * Testcase Example:  '3'
 *
 * Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the k^th index row of the
 * Pascal's triangle.
 * 
 * Note that the row index starts from 0.
 * 
 * 
 * In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly
 * above it.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: [1,3,3,1]
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
