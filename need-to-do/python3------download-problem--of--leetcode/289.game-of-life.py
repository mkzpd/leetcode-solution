# According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as
# Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
# Horton Conway in 1970."
# 
# Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
# dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical,
# diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
# article):
# 
# 
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
# under-population.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
# generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
# over-population..
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
# reproduction.
# 
# 
# Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
# given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above
# rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and
# deaths occur simultaneously.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# [
# [0,1,0],
# [0,0,1],
# [1,1,1],
# [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 
# [
# [0,0,0],
# [1,0,1],
# [0,1,1],
# [0,1,0]
# ]
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at
# the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated
# values to update other cells.
# In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the
# board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches
# the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
