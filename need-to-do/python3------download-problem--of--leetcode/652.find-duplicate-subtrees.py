#
# Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of
# duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of
# them.
# 
# Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node
# values.
# 
# Example 1: 
# 
# 
# ⁠       1
# ⁠      / \
# ⁠     2   3
# ⁠    /   / \
# ⁠   4   2   4
# ⁠      /
# ⁠     4
# 
# 
# The following are two duplicate subtrees:
# 
# 
# ⁠     2
# ⁠    /
# ⁠   4
# 
# 
# and
# 
# 
# ⁠   4
# 
# Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def findDuplicateSubtrees(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[TreeNode]:
