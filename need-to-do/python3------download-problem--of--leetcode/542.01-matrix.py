#
# Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for
# each cell.
# 
# The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1: 
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0],
# ⁠[0,0,0]]
# 
# Output:
# [[0,0,0],
# [0,1,0],
# [0,0,0]]
# 
# 
# Example 2: 
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0],
# ⁠[1,1,1]]
# 
# Output:
# [[0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0],
# ⁠[1,2,1]]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
# There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
# The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.
#
