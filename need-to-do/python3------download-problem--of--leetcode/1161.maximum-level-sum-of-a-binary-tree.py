#
# Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its
# children is 2, and so on.
# 
# Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at
# level X is maximal.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# Level 1 sum = 1.
# Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
# Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
# So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given tree is between 1 and 10^4.
# -10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
