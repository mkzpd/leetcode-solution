# Testcase Example:  '"abbaca"'
#
# Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of
# choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
# 
# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
# 
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It
# is guaranteed the answer is unique.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "abbaca"
# Output: "ca"
# Explanation: 
# For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent
# and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is
# that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final
# string is "ca".
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= S.length <= 20000
# S consists only of English lowercase letters.
#

    def removeDuplicates(self, S: str) -> str:
