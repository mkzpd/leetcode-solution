# 
# Given a non-negative integer N, find the largest number that is less than or
# equal to N with monotone increasing digits.
# 
# (Recall that an integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each
# pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x .)
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: N = 10
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: N = 1234
# Output: 1234
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: N = 332
# Output: 299
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# N is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
