# Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.
# 
# Example:
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15
# respectively. Return 24.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
