#
# Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is
# described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person
# and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height
# greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
# 
# Note:
# The number of people is less than 1,100.
# 
# 
# Example
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
# 
# Output:
# [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
