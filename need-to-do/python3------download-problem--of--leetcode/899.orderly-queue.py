# Testcase Example:  '"cba"\n1'
#
# A string S of lowercase letters is given.  Then, we may make any number of
# moves.
# 
# In each move, we choose one of the first K letters (starting from the left),
# remove it, and place it at the end of the string.
# 
# Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number
# of moves.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "cba", K = 1
# Output: "acb"
# Explanation: 
# In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the
# string "bac".
# In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the
# final result "acb".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "baaca", K = 3
# Output: "aaabc"
# Explanation: 
# In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the
# string "aacab".
# In the second move, we move the 3rd character ("c") to the end, obtaining the
# final result "aaabc".
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= K <= S.length <= 1000
# S consists of lowercase letters only.
# 
#
