#
# In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters,
# but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some
# permutation of lowercase letters.
# 
# Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the
# alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted
# lexicographicaly in this alien language.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: true
# Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is
# sorted.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] >
# words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is
# shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app",
# because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less
# than any other character (More info).
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
# order.length == 26
# All characters in words[i] and order are english lowercase letters.
# 
# 
# 
# 
#

    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
