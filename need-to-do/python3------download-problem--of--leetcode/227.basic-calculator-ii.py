#
# Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
# 
# The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, /
# operators and empty spaces  . The integer division should truncate toward
# zero.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "3+2*2"
# Output: 7
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: " 3/2 "
# Output: 1
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
# Do not use the eval built-in library function.
