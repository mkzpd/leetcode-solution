# Testcase Example:  '[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]'
#
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
# subsequence.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
# Output: 4 
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the
# length is 4. 
# 
# Note: 
# 
# 
# There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to
# return the length.
# Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
#

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
