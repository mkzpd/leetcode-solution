#
# Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j,
# k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.
# 
# To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤
# N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -2^28 to 2^28 - 1 and the result is
# guaranteed to be at most 2^31 - 1.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# A = [ 1, 2]
# B = [-2,-1]
# C = [-1, 2]
# D = [ 0, 2]
# 
# Output:
# 2
# 
# Explanation:
# The two tuples are:
# 1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
# 2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
# 
# 
#

class Solution:
    def fourSumCount(self, A: List[int], B: List[int], C: List[int], D: List[int]) -> int:
