#
# Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
# 
# 
# void addWord(word)
# bool search(word)
# 
# 
# search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string
# containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# addWord("bad")
# addWord("dad")
# addWord("mad")
# search("pad") -> false
# search("bad") -> true
# search(".ad") -> true
# search("b..") -> true
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
