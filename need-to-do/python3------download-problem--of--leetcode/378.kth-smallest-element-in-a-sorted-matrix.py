#
# Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in
# ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.
# 
# 
# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth
# distinct element.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# matrix = [
# ⁠  [ 1,  5,  9],
# ⁠  [10, 11, 13],
# ⁠  [12, 13, 15]
# ],
# k = 8,
# 
# return 13.
# 
# 
# 
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n^2.
#
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
