# Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]\n4\n2'
#
# There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
# 
# Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
# where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes
# for a signal to travel from source to target.
# 
# Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all
# nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# N will be in the range [1, 100].
# K will be in the range [1, N].
# The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
# All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.
#

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], N: int, K: int) -> int:
