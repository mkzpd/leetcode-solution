#
# A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly
# the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
# 
# Write a data structure CBTInserter that is initialized with a complete binary
# tree and supports the following operations:
# 
# 
# CBTInserter(TreeNode root) initializes the data structure on a given tree
# with head node root;
# CBTInserter.insert(int v) will insert a TreeNode into the tree with value
# node.val = v so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the
# parent of the inserted TreeNode;
# CBTInserter.get_root() will return the head node of the tree.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
# Output: [null,1,[1,2]]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","insert","get_root"], inputs =
# [[[1,2,3,4,5,6]],[7],[8],[]]
# Output: [null,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The initial given tree is complete and contains between 1 and 1000 nodes.
# CBTInserter.insert is called at most 10000 times per test case.
# Every value of a given or inserted node is between 0 and 5000.
