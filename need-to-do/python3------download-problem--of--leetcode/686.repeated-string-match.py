# Testcase Example:  '"abcd"\n"cdabcdab"'
#
# Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be
# repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
# 
# For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
# 
# Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a
# substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times
# ("abcdabcd").
# 
# Note:
# The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
#

class Solution:
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A: str, B: str) -> int:
