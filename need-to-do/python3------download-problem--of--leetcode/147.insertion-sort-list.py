# Sort a linked list using insertion sort.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# A graphical example of insertion sort. The partial sorted list (black)
# initially contains only the first element in the list.
# With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and
# inserted in-place into the sorted list
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Algorithm of Insertion Sort:
# 
# 
# Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and
# growing a sorted output list.
# At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data,
# finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it
# there.
# It repeats until no input elements remain.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 4->2->1->3
# Output: 1->2->3->4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: -1->5->3->4->0
# Output: -1->0->3->4->5
#

#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
