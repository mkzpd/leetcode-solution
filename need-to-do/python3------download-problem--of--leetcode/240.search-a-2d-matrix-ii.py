# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
# This matrix has the following properties:
# 
# 
# Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
# Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Consider the following matrix:
# 
# 
# [
# ⁠ [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
# ⁠ [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
# ⁠ [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
# ⁠ [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
# ⁠ [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
# ]
# 
# 
# Given target = 5, return true.
# 
# Given target = 20, return false.
