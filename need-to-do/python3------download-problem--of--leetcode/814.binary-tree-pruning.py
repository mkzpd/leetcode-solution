# Testcase Example:  '[1,null,0,0,1]'
#
# We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every
# node's value is either a 0 or a 1.
# 
# Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a
# 1 has been removed.
# 
# (Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a
# descendant of X.)
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
# Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
# ⁠
# Explanation: 
# Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
# The diagram on the right represents the answer.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
# Output: [1,null,1,null,1]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
# Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: 
# 
# 
# The binary tree will have at most 100 nodes.
# The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def pruneTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
