 * Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of
 * duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of
 * them.
 * 
 * Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node
 * values.
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠       1
 * ⁠      / \
 * ⁠     2   3
 * ⁠    /   / \
 * ⁠   4   2   4
 * ⁠      /
 * ⁠     4
 * 
 * 
 * The following are two duplicate subtrees:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠     2
 * ⁠    /
 * ⁠   4
 * 
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠   4
 * 
 * Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
