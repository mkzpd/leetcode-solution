 *
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and
 * arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the
 * tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin
 * with JFK.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary
 * that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For
 * example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than
 * ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
 * Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is
 * ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
 * But it is larger in lexical order.
