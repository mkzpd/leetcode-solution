 *
 * Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.  Find all possible paths from
 * node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.
 * 
 * The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.
 * graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
 * Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
 * Explanation: The graph looks like this:
 * 0--->1
 * |    |
 * v    v
 * 2--->3
 * There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
 * You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of
 * nodes inside one path.
