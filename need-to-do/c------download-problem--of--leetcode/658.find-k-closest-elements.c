 *
 * 
 * Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x
 * in the array.  The result should also be sorted in ascending order.
 * If there is a tie,  the smaller elements are always preferred.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the
 * sorted array.
 * ⁠Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10^4
 * ⁠Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10^4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * UPDATE (2017/9/19):
 * The arr parameter had been changed to an array of integers (instead of a
 * list of integers). Please reload the code definition to get the latest
 * changes.
