 * Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design
 * TinyURL.
 * 
 * TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such
 * as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
 * 
 * Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no
 * restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need
 * to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be
 * decoded to the original URL.

/** Encodes a URL to a shortened URL. */
char* encode(char* longUrl) {

/** Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL. */
char* decode(char* shortUrl) {

// Your functions will be called as such:
// char* s = encode(s);
// decode(s);
