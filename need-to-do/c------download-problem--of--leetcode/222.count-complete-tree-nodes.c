 * Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
 * 
 * Note: 
 * 
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is
 * completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
 * possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level
 * h.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   3
 * ⁠/ \  /
 * 4  5 6
 * 
 * Output: 6
