 * Total Submissions: 48.1K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,null,0,0,1]'
 *
 * We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every
 * node's value is either a 0 or a 1.
 * 
 * Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing
 * a 1 has been removed.
 * 
 * (Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a
 * descendant of X.)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
 * Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 * ⁠
 * Explanation: 
 * Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
 * The diagram on the right represents the answer.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
 * Output: [1,null,1,null,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
 * Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: 
 * 
 * 
 * The binary tree will have at most 100 nodes.
 * The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.
