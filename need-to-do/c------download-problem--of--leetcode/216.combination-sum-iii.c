 *
 * 
 * Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given
 * that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a
 * unique set of numbers.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * All numbers will be positive integers.
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: k = 3, n = 7
 * Output: [[1,2,4]]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: k = 3, n = 9
 * Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
