 *
 * In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 
 * The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * A.length <= 30000
 * 0 <= S <= A.length
 * A[i] is either 0 or 1.
