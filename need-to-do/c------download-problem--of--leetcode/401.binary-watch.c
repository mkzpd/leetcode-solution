 * Total Submissions: 141.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '0'
 *
 * A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and
 * the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
 * Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the
 * right.
 * 
 * For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
 * 
 * Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are
 * currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 1Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04",
 * "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The order of output does not matter.
 * The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid,
 * it should be "1:00".
 * The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for
 * example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".
