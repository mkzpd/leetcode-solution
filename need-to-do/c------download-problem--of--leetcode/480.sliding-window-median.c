 * Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the
 * list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two
 * middle value.
 * Examples: 
 * [2,3,4] , the median is 3
 * [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 
 * 
 * Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving
 * from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k
 * numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one
 * position. Your job is to output the median array for each window in the
 * original array.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Window position                Median
 * ---------------               -----
 * [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       1
 * ⁠1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 * ⁠1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1
 * ⁠1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       3
 * ⁠1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       5
 * ⁠1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      6
 * 
 * 
 * Therefore, return the median sliding window as [1,-1,-1,3,5,6].
 * 
 * Note: 
 * You may assume k is always valid, ie: k is always smaller than input array's
 * size for non-empty array.
